--- Executes the given f over all elements of `table`. For each element, `f` is

--- visited in sequential order, from 1 to `n`, where `n` is the size of the `table`
--- (see 5.4). If `f` returns a non-nil value, then the loop is broken and this

---
--- Returns a formatted version of its variable number of arguments following
--- the description given in its first argument (which must be a string). The
--- format string follows the same rules as the ISO C function `sprintf`. The
--- only differences are that the options/modifiers `*`, `h`, `L`, `l`, `n`, and
--- `p` are not supported and that there is an extra option, `q`.
---
--- The `q` option formats booleans, nil, numbers, and strings in a way that the
--- result is a valid constant in Lua source code. Booleans and nil are written
--- in the obvious way (`true`, `false`, `nil`). Floats are written in
--- hexadecimal, to preserve full precision. A string is written between double
--- quotes, using escape sequences when necessary to ensure that it can safely
--- be read back by the Lua interpreter. For instance, the call
---
--- format('%q', 'a string with "quotes" and \n new line') may produce
--- the string:
---
--- > "a string with \"quotes\" and \
--- > new line"
---
--- The options `A`, `a`, `E`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `G` and `g` all expect a number as
--- argument. Options `c`, `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `X`, and `x` expect an integer.
--- When Lua is compiled with a C89 compiler, options `A` and `a` (hexadecimal
--- floats) do not support any modifier (flags, width, length).
---
--- Option `s` expects a string; if its argument is not a string, it is
--- converted to one following the same rules of `tostring`. If the option
--- has any modifier (flags, width, length), the string argument should not
--- contain embedded zeros.
---@param formatstring string

function format(formatstring, ...) end

---
--- Returns `m` and `e` such that *x = m2^e*, `e` is an integer and the

---@param x number
---@return number
function frexp(x) end

---
--- Returns the size of a table, when seen as a list. If the table has an n field
--- with a numeric value, this value is the size of the table. Otherwise, if there
--- was a previous call to table.setn over this table, the respective value is
--- returned. Otherwise, the size is one less the first integer index with a nil value.
---@param table table
---@return number
function getn(table) end

---
--- Returns a copy of `s` in which all occurrences of the pattern `pat` have
--- been replaced by a replacement string specified by `repl`. `gsub` also
--- returns, as a second value, the total number of substitutions made.
---
--- If `repl` is a string, then its value is used for replacement. Any sequence
--- in `repl` of the form `%n`, with `n` between 1 and 9, stands for the value
--- of the `n`-th captured substring (see below).
---
--- If `repl` is a function, then this function is called every time a match
--- occurs, with all captured substrings passed as arguments, in order; if the
--- pattern specifies no captures, then the whole match is passed as a sole
--- argument. If the value returned by this function is a string, then it is
--- used as the replacement string; otherwise, the replacement string is the
--- empty string.
---
--- The optional last parameter `n` limits the maximum number of substitutions
--- to occur. For instance, when `n` is 1 only the first occurrence of `pat` is
--- replaced.
---
--- Here are some examples:
--- `x = string.gsub("hello world", "(%w+)", "%1 %1")`
--- `--> x="hello hello world world"`
--- `x = string.gsub("hello world", "%w+", "%0 %0", 1)`
--- `--> x="hello hello world"`
--- `x = string.gsub("hello world from Lua", "(%w+)%s*(%w+)", "%2 %1")`
--- `--> x="world hello Lua from"`
--- `x = string.gsub("home = $HOME, user = $USER", "%$(%w+)", os.getenv)`
--- `--> x="home = /home/roberto, user = roberto"`
--- `x = string.gsub("4+5 = $return 4+5$", "%$(.-)%$", function (s)`
---  >> return loadstring(s)()
---  > end)
--- `--> x="4+5 = 9"`
--- `local t = {name="lua", version="5.0"}
--- `x = string.gsub("$name_$version.tar.gz", "%$(%w+)", function (v)`
--- `--> x="lua_5.0.tar.gz"`

--- Sorts list elements in a given order, *in-place*, from `list[1]` to

--- two list elements and returns true when the first element must come before
--- the second in the final order (so that, after the sort, `i < j` implies not
--- `comp(list[j],list[i]))`. If `comp` is not given, then the standard Lua
--- operator `<` is used instead.
---
--- Note that the `comp` function must define a strict partial order over the
--- elements in the list; that is, it must be asymmetric and transitive.
--- Otherwise, no valid sort may be possible.
---
--- The sort algorithm is not stable: elements considered equal by the given

--- Returns the internal numerical code of the `i`-th character of `s`, or **nil**

---
--- Looks for the first match of `pattern` in the string `s`. If it finds a
--- match, then `find` returns the indices of `s` where this occurrence starts
--- and ends; otherwise, it returns **nil**. A third, optional numerical
--- argument `init` specifies where to start the search; its default value is 1
--- and can be negative. A value of **true** as a fourth, optional argument
--- `plain` turns off the pattern matching facilities, so the function does a
--- plain "find substring" operation, with no characters in `pattern` being
--- considered "magic". Note that if `plain` is given, then `init` must be given
--- as well.
---
--- If the pattern has captures, then in a successful match the captured values

---
--- If, after the translation of negative indices, `i` is less than 1, it is
