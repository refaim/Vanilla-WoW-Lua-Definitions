Enabling this property does not automatically implement behaviors allowing the frame to be dragged by the user â€” such behavior must be implemented in the frame's mouse script handlers.

--- Sets whether the frame's boundaries should be limited to those of the screen. Applies to user moving/resizing of the frame (via :StartMoving(), :StartSizing(), or title region); attempting to move or resize the frame beyond the edges of the screen will move/resize it no further than the edge of the screen closest to the mouse position. Does not apply to programmatically setting the frame's position or size.
